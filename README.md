# MURANO-QUESTAO7
Code for question 7 - stock data analysis
The code was written in python for easier plotting.\
To run it, the user just needs to run the file with a python interpreter.\
It must contain the following libraries: \
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html).\
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/install.html).\
[numpy](https://numpy.org/install/).\
[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html).\
The user must also download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs), extract the Data folder, and put it ont the same folder as the .py.\
When predicting a stock, make sure to change the degree of the polynomial in order to fit better the actual stock price (this process must be done mannualy, unfortunatelly).
